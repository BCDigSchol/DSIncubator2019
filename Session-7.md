#### Session 7 (4/24/2019): Crit Session
Participants will reflect upon their project for an audience of their fellow creators. Each round of reflection will follow this structure:
1. Incubator participant presents project, drawing upon revised project proposal and [final reflection](https://github.com/BCDigSchol/DSIncubator/blob/master/Reflections/final.md) (5 minutes).
2. Incubator facilitators and other participants ask questions and offer feedback (7-10 minutes).

We ask that participants send their revised proposal and final reflection to spring-2019-digital-scholarship-incubator@googlegroups.com by Friday, April 19.
