### Questions to Consider

- What is the story that the author(s) appear to be trying to convey? 
- Is the design effective for the story?
- What is the underlying data source?
- What goal or research question does this map addresses? Is it clear?
- Is it interactive, if so, how?
- How was the visualization created? Do you know which software, tools, methods, etc. were used?
- Is it user-friendly? If not, why and what would you improve?
- Any other observations?



# Exercise 2

Consider your own research or pedagogical needs. What type of question(s) or arguments can you make with a spatial visualization? Reflect on these and other questions while drawing or sketching out a dataset, map, or other visualization.

- What type of map would help you answer this question?
- How could you use spatial visualization in a class setting?
- What type of data source(s) would you need? 
- Would you create your own data or require an existing dataset?
- What kind of resources might you need access to?
